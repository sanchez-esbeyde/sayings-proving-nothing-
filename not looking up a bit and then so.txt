What they don’t realize is how quickly the suffering is heightened- in one moment, it is no longer their suffering but completely yours; you cannot live with it, but you cannot live without it. It’s ludicrous- and completely reasonable.. it is the harshest inconvenience, it is pleasurably the most agreeable notion- endearment, in her most intimate form, brings such devotion- and such anguish. 


An affliction, a compromise, and an anxious hope.

a recent experience
left me thoroughly elated-
the anticipation of first contact
enough excitement for me to consider-
an entire forum! a council! a summit!


immediate emotions were not of
mere two people meeting
present intensity was….
Everything. All of everything, everywhere.


the silence in the meeting- breathtaking, every moment, movement- completely captivating. I’ve not met a silence so exotic, entirely an essence, it had a soul of its own.. Though I would not say a mind, Silence is bashfully irrational. To some- I am sure comical, but to me, Silence was regal, and untouchable. Yet I do not lose hope, I will not accept that feeling as unattainalbe.
